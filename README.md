100% C++ seating system
What this project does.

1. Allows the user to enter in a desired amount or rows and columns.
2. Displays the desired amount of seats.
   Open seats are marked by a '0' and taken seats are marked by a 'X'.
4. Loops through the seating chart my prompting the user to enter their the seat they would like.
  The loop continues if the user wishes to do so. Or stops the loop and displays the updated seating chart.
    If a user tries to book a taken seat, a message will be displayed saying that the seat is already booked and they will be allowed to choose again.
